    print('Amphibians are small vertebrates that need water, or a moist environment, to survive. The species in this group include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. All can breathe and absorb water through their very thin skin. Amphibians also have special skin glands that produce useful proteins.')

    print('Amphibians will pretty much eat anything live that they can fit in their mouths! This includes bugs, slugs, snails, other frogs, spiders, worms, mice or even birds and bats (if the frog is big enough and the bird or bat small enough).')
