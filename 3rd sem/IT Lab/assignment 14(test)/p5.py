'''5) A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5).
Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each different type of product sold.
Each slip contains:
a) The salesperson number.
b) The product number.
c) The number of that product sold that day.
Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. Assume that
the information from all of the slips for last month is available. Write a program that will
read all this information for last monthâ€™s sales and summarize the total sales by
salesperson by product. All totals should be stored in list sales. After processing all the
information for last month, display the results in tabular format, with each of the columns
representing a particular salesperson and each of the rows representing a particular
product. Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each product for last month;
cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month. Your
tabular printout should include these cross-totals to the right of the totaled rows and at
the bottom of the totaled columns.'''
